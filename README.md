# EnLiven-App

This is the github page for our vector-based animation engine web broswer, EnLiven.

To get started, press the animate tab in the nav bar which will take you to our animation page. 

From here, you can add on a sprite by clicking the add part in the navbar.

The timeline at the button will allow you to add frames and pla through them.

Just like this you can start animating!
